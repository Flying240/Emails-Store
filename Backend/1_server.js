    Parsing JSON Data:
        When a client sends a *request with a JSON body, the request payload is typically sent as a string of text*.
        To work with this data in a JavaScript-friendly format, it needs to be converted (or parsed) into a JavaScript object.
        The express.json() middleware function automatically *parses incoming requests with JSON payloads* and makes the
        data available in req.body as a JavaScript object.

    Middleware:
        app.use() is a middleware function in Express. 
        Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and 
        the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
        In this case, express.json() is used to process all incoming requests with a Content-Type header of application/json.
        YOU WILL see this in /frontend/create when you create users
